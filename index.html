                Geekonix is the official science and technology club of Techno
                Main Salt Lake. It was formed back in 2004-2005 with the sole
                motive of providing ardent students with opportunities which
                would enhance their creativity. Its foundation led to the
                development of a pathway for innovative minds to showcase their
                competence in various technical fields.

                  <h4>Inception</h4>
                  <p>
                    Everything began with a Yahoo Group. A common chat forum for
                    all likeminded people to voice their thoughts. Discussions
                    ranged from using Linux, making Linux user groups,
                    exchanging ideas about software and projects. For some, it
                    all started one day with a seminar organized by the senior
                    Geekonix members for an introduction to the club which was
                    trying to make its presence felt outside of the Yahoo group.
                    <span id="dots1">...</span>
                    <span id="more1">
                      Shortly afterward, on Sept’06 a mail was sent with a link
                      to join the Yahoo group to only 25 people who presumably
                      turned up and expressed their interest to join the club.
                      Most of them, if not all, ended up playing really
                      important roles in the growth of Geekonix and also its
                      brainchild Edge.

                <h4>Ideation</h4>
                <p>
                  As per another of our Geek Alum, something like this led to
                  the establishment of Edge: - One day, Members were called only
                  to talk and ideate in a computer lab, where they first met
                  with some founder members of Geekonix. They all were planning
                  for the first-ever independent Technological Fest of our
                  college. Those guys, along with two girls, started a wall
                  magazine, specifically for science and technology. Later in
                  2005 that became the first-ever tech fest of our college but
                  <span id="dots2">...</span>
                  <span id="more2">
                    as a part of Anakhronos, our popular and established
                    cultural fest. The success and popularity prompted the
                    creation of Edge’07. Later more geeks joined the force, and
                    our very first website for Edge’07 — Think Beyond, was put
                    together.

                <h4>Execution.</h4>
                <p>
                  According to our another geek alum it was a very painful time.
                  When the actual planning for the event began— struggling to
                  figure out how to approach companies for sponsorship, how to
                  build a website, how to get a domain name, how to get
                  permission from college — it was quickly realized that a name
                  was needed. A name for the tech-fest, a brand to portray to
                  sponsors. “Edge”, the brainchild of many, started its journey
                  in the year 2007 with the tagline “Think Beyond”. As with any
                  change, Techno India didn’t seem to be quite welcoming about
                  the idea. Edge did not get any official recognition. Yet, the
                  team managed to overcome that by getting sponsors, first of
                  those times when all the fests completely relied on college
                  funds. The fest was held on weekends to not disturb the normal
                  college schedule.
                  <span id="dots3">...</span>
                  <span id="more3">
                    There was no access to infrastructure, so Edge had to rent
                    its own server, buy its own domain name (at a time when
                    getting a credit card was not easy). After overcoming all
                    hurdles, the first website was launched at edg.co.in. Edge
                    eventually matured with each iteration. It got better and
                    grew in popularity as well as fame. Along with the fest, the
                    team grew, matured and became more confident. But, as they
                    say, some things never change. Even after 13 iterations, our
                    spirit to never give up is still the same. Our zeal and
                    quest to improve our very own EDGE is still there, driving
                    us to give our best each time.

                <h4>Journey so far</h4>
                <p>
                  After being stopped by numerous hurdles and obstacles on their
                  way to eclipsing themselves with each passing year, the team
                  finally launched its first website edg.co.in, which started
                  expanding with each iteration. From just having one event
                  under the banner to organizing 40+ events in a 3-day fest,
                  Edge has only risen above echelons since its inception.
                  Edge'10 first witnessed the most-talked night of the town,
                  Edge Night. Since then, there has been no turning back. We
                  have witnessed famed stand-up comics like Rahul Subhramaniam,
                  The Viral Fever, Sahil Shah, Zakir Khan, Sorabh Pant and many
                  more grace the stage and light up the night. Along with it,
                  Edge Talks brought us famed speakers and celebrities from
                  across the nation in RJ Praveen, Yahya Bootwala and a lot
                  more. The Central Government of India organized a Smart India
                  Hackathon in 2018 in collaboration with Techno India Group and
                  GEEKONIX,by then the established science and technology club
                  of Techno Main,Salt lake.
                  <span id="dots">...</span>
                  <span id="more">
                    This helped the members of the club to gain more exposure
                    than ever before and it's brainchild Edge to spread its
                    wings above and beyond. Besides the technical aspect of
                    reaching greatness, the club also started looking after the
                    aspects of society from 2016 in its program of EDGE Deeds
                    where various programs like Walkathon, Orphanage Visit,
                    Cleanliness Drive, etc are held. The year 2016, the 10th
                    iteration also saw EDGE become the second-largest Technical
                    Fest in Eastern India and since then the geek members have
                    maintained this stature with a footfall of about 7000
                    students showcasing the best of their talents to take home a
                    prize money of about 7 lakhs, only rising every year. One of
                    the most sought-after events of Edge remains to this day,
                    Cyber Crusade, the gaming paradise. The most recent editions
                    have witnessed participation from all across the nation
                    including famed games from national champions of CS: GO and
                    team members of famed PUBG clans as in Soul and 8Bit.
                    Lagging no behind has been members of the entrepreneurial
                    committee of Geekonix who were invited to an international
                    congregation in Singapore to pitch and discuss their ideas
                    of a start-up. INDRO, the humanoid robot was present at the
                    inaugural ceremony of EDGE,19 to grace the initiation of the
                    three-day event. To sum it up, Geekonix has only seen rise
                    at a cosmic rate and will only work towards reaching the
                    zenith.
